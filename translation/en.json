			"p1": "The development of a country depends on the training of its young people and their integration into production circuits. Clearly, to be emerging in 2035, as invoked by the government of the Republic, there must be an emphasis on the professionalization of teaching in Higher Education. This, of course, presupposes training in entrepreneurship, the setting up of professional training and support for the creation of businesses, a breeding ground for job creation.",
			"p2": "The training component appears, as such, to be the cornerstone for any sustainable development. This explaining this, we understand the flowering of Institutes of Higher Education in our country for some time.",
			"p3": "Unfortunately, it is clear that, despite the flowering of IPES (Private Institute of Higher Education) in Cameroon, there is still a gap between training and the skills sought by employers."
		},
		"miscont": {
			"p1": "Armed with all the above, I have decided in order to leave the knowledge that is ours to prosperity, to form a group of Professors for the creation of an IPES which will respond to the Training/Employment match, which will allow sure to contribute to the emergence so desired by the President of the Republic, of Cameroon, horizon 2035.",
			"p2": "BIAST, Bilingual University Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (Bilingual Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology) is therefore the emanation of a group of Professors from Cameroonian universities and from outside, concerned about the future and the training of Cameroonian youth and Africa for sustainable development, hence our slogan 'Applied Sciences and Technologies at the service of Sustainable Development'.",
			"p3": "The added value that we bring in this sector is based on two points:",
			"p4": "The real professionalization of teaching: At BIAST we try to create in all specialties and this through our workshops (workshops) the appropriate industrial environment in which the graduating student is called upon to practice;",
			"p5": "Entrepreneurship: After analysis, this group of Professors realized that even when young people are well trained, they are still waiting to be employed. However, as we all know, we are currently in an era where the public service no longer absorbs all graduates of Higher Education."
		},
		"viscont": {
			"p1": "This is where BIAST stands out from other IPES, in the sense that before the end of the training each student develops a bankable project in which he must realize himself at the end of his studies. In relation to the means available, we will help them as much as possible to implement their project.",
			"p2": "It would not be superfluous while concluding this word, to specify that we have innovative sectors such as: Maintenance of Biomedical Devices (MAB), Surveyor Topographer (GT); Geotechnics and Applied Geology (GGA) to name but a few.",
			"p3": "In addition to all these BTS / HND training provided in our two campuses in Bafoussam - Cameroon, we have, with our partners, created initial training (02) two years on site, and the possibility of obtaining the direct registration of your children in the Grandes Ecoles of Engineering and Medicine in partner universities in Africa and Europe.",
			"p4": "Ladies and Gentlemen, You who are just visiting this site, not only do we thank you for your interest in our structure, but we also ask you, in order to have ample information, to go to the different headings."
